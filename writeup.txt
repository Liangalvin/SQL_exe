1 In your own words: what is a database?

A database is a technological file cabinet, that allows for easy accessibility
to information.


2 List some problems with using files instead of a database.

Problems associated with files instead of database is the lack of structure.
A file lacks the computerized cataloging system of the database, leading tostuff
being messy.


3 What is a schema (google may confuse you here)?

The schema is the actual structure of the database. The schema of the file
cabinet can have the schema of alphabets. If a person was literate with common
sense, they would be able to access information under that letter of the
alphabet.


4 When you are not specifically adding/deleting or querying your database, is it still running?

Technically yes because it's job is to hold information, so it's holding
information even when you're not doing anything. Like Atlas holding up the
world, but a database is holding onto information.
